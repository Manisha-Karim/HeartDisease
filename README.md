Three datasets gathered from the UCI repository were combined to produce a unique dataset. The data was cleaned using Pandas and Numpy, and the null values were filled using a KNN imputer. Using Seaborn, EDA was used to choose the best features. Finally, four classifiers (KNN, DT, and RF) were fitted with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
